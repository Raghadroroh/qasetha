# Profile Photo Upload Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds secure profile photo upload functionality to the Qasetha Flutter app, with proper user authentication, image validation, optimization, and guest user restrictions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Firebase Storage Integration
- **Package**: `firebase_storage: ^12.4.9` (already installed)
- **Additional Dependencies Added**:
  - `cached_network_image: ^3.3.1` - For efficient image caching and display
  - `image: ^4.1.7` - For image optimization and processing

### 2. Enhanced FirebaseStorageService
**Location**: `lib/services/firebase_storage_service.dart`

**New Features**:
- **Image Validation**:
  - File size limit: 5MB maximum
  - Allowed formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG only
  - Image integrity verification
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Automatic resizing (max 800x800 pixels)
  - JPEG compression with 85% quality
  - Significant file size reduction
- **Storage Organization**:
  - Files stored in `/profiles/{userId}/{filename}`
  - Automatic cleanup of old profile images
- **Firestore Integration**:
  - Updates both `users` and `userProfiles` collections
  - Stores profile image URLs with metadata

### 3. ProfilePhotoUpload Widget
**Location**: `lib/widgets/profile_photo_upload.dart`

**Features**:
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Animated glow effects
  - Real-time upload progress
  - Touch feedback with haptics
- **Image Selection**:
  - Camera capture support
  - Gallery selection
  - Bottom sheet picker interface
- **User Experience**:

- **Call-to-Action**: Direct signup redirection
- **Contextual Messages**: Feature-specific restriction explanations

### 5. Firebase Security Rules
**Location**: `storage.rules`

**Security Model**:
```javascript
// Profile pictures: Only the user can upload/update their own picture, everyone can read
match /profiles/{userId}/{fileName} {
  // Anyone can read profile pictures (for viewing in app)
  allow read: if true;
  
  // Only authenticated users can write/update their own profile picture
  allow write: if request.auth != null 
               && request.auth.uid == userId
               && isValidProfileImage();
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Allowed content types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/jpg`
- User ownership verification

### 6. Integration with Profile Screen
**Location**: `lib/screens/profile_screen_new.dart`

**Changes**:
- Replaced static profile image display with `ProfilePhotoUpload` widget
- Added real-time profile refresh on image updates
- Maintained existing animations and styling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Authenticated Users**:
   - Can upload, change, and delete profile pictures
   - Images stored securely in Firebase Storage
   - URLs saved to Firestore user documents

2. **Guest Users**:
   - Profile photo functionality is locked
   - Informative dialogs explain benefits of registration
   - Smooth conversion flow to create accounts

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Selection**: Camera or gallery via `image_picker`
2. **Validation**: File size, format, and integrity checks
3. **Optimization**: Resize and compress for optimal storage
4. **Upload**: Secure transfer to Firebase Storage with progress tracking
5. **Update**: Firestore document update with new image URL
6. **Display**: Cached image rendering with fallback handling

### Error Handling
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation with retry options
- **Invalid Files**: Clear error messages with format guidance
- **Upload Failures**: Rollback mechanisms and user notifications
- **Permission Errors**: Appropriate security feedback

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Caching**: `cached_network_image` reduces bandwidth usage
- **Progressive Upload**: Visual progress feedback during uploads
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and resources

## Security Considerations

### 1. User Authentication
- Only authenticated users can upload images
- User ID verification prevents unauthorized access
- Firebase Auth integration ensures secure sessions

### 2. File Validation
- Server-side validation through Storage Rules
- Client-side pre-validation for better UX
- Content type verification prevents malicious uploads

### 3. Storage Organization
- User-specific directories prevent cross-user access
- Timestamped filenames prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat

### 4. Data Privacy
- Images stored in secure Firebase Storage
- URLs are publicly readable but unpredictable
- User controls their own profile data

## User Experience Features

### 1. Visual Feedback
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time progress bars
- **Success States**: Confirmation animations and messages
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with guidance
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and spinners

### 2. Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic labels
- **Touch Targets**: Adequate button sizes for accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast for visibility
- **Haptic Feedback**: Touch confirmation for actions

### 3. Responsive Design
- **Device Adaptation**: Works on phones and tablets
- **Orientation Support**: Portrait and landscape modes
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode compatibility

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Authenticated User Tests
- ✅ Upload new profile picture from camera
- ✅ Select image from gallery
- ✅ Replace existing profile picture
- ✅ Remove profile picture
- ✅ Handle upload errors gracefully

### 2. Guest User Tests
- ✅ Show restriction dialog when attempting upload
- ✅ Redirect to signup from restriction dialog
- ✅ Display locked state for profile photo areas
- ✅ Maintain app functionality for other features

### 3. Edge Case Tests
- ✅ Large file size handling (>5MB)
- ✅ Unsupported file formats
- ✅ Network connectivity issues
- ✅ Corrupted image files
- ✅ Storage quota limits

## Monitoring and Analytics
